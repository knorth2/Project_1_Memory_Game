# Project_1_Memory_Game
 Time to test your mental strength with the classic memory game, Concentration. This is a two-person memory game that I created and styled using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript for my first project in my Software Engineering Immersive course I am taking through General Assembly. 
 Currently the game can only be played on a desktop browser so there is no installation required. 
 A few unsolved problems I found in my gameWin()logic was it wouldn't recognize the conditional saying Player One won unless I switched the greater than sign to less than.
 I would like to add sound effects to the cards when flipped and matched vs flipped and don't match. I would also like to make my game playable on other devices.
 I hope you enjoy it!
