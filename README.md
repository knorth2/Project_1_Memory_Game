# Project_1_Memory_Game
 Time to test your mental strength with the classic memory game, Concentration. This is a two-person memory game that I created and styled using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript for my first project in my Software Engineering Immersive course I am taking through General Assembly. I hope you enjoy it!
